# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains my practical exercises for the CP1404 subject, focused on learning and applying various
programming patterns and principles in Python.

## About the Author

I am a student of CP1404, working to improve my programming skills and understanding of software development concepts,
especially clean code and best practices in Python.

## Main Lessons on Clean Code

- **Readability:** Writing code that is easy for others (and myself) to read and understand. This includes clear
  variable names, consistent formatting, and avoiding overly complex solutions.
- **Modularity:** Breaking down tasks into functions and classes, allowing code to be reused and tested individually,
  which simplifies debugging and enhances functionality.
- **Consistency:** Following naming conventions, indentation, and other stylistic guidelines consistently throughout the
  code to avoid confusion and ensure that the codebase remains professional and easy to follow.
