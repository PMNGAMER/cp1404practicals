Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was inconsistent at first. I often underestimated how long tasks would take, particularly when learning new concepts or debugging issues.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, my estimates became more realistic as I gained experience and a better understanding of the complexity of tasks. I learned to account for unexpected challenges and testing phases.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable parts and estimating for each part individually. This approach improved my ability to allocate time effectively and prioritize work.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to approach problems from different perspectives and gained valuable feedback on improving code readability, efficiency, and best practices.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code helped me recognize common mistakes, learn new techniques, and improve my ability to explain and justify coding choices. It also reinforced my understanding of key concepts.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would provide more guided examples for some of the more advanced tasks early on to help students build confidence. Additionally, Iâ€™d introduce pair programming sessions to encourage collaboration and peer learning.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently tested my code thoroughly, ensuring it worked for various edge cases. I also kept my code clean and followed best practices, such as meaningful variable names and detailed comments, making it easier to understand and review.
